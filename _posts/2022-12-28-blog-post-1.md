Because of their small size, it has been easy for stalkers and abusers to place these devices in purses, cars, bags.
What can you do if you are concerned about one of these trackers?

## Apple AirTags
**Case 1**: you have an iPhone
* Your phone will automatically scan for AirTags in your surrounding and will show you a notification if it detects an unwanted AirTag moving with you. Make sure that the following settings are on:

* **Bluetooth** (Settings > Bluetooth)
* **Location Services** (Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services)
* **Tracking Notifications** (Settings > Notifications > Tracking Notifications)

**Case 2**: you have an Android phone (e.g., Google Pixel, Samsung, LG, etc.)
* Go to Google Play and install an app called [Tracker Detect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect&hl=en_US&gl=US). You will have to manually tap on Scan. Alternatively, install [AirGuard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.seemoo.at_tracking_detection.release&hl=en_US&gl=US), an app developed by [researchers from TU Darmstadt](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11813.pdf) in Germany.

## Tile trackers
Install the Tile app and use the **Scan and Secure** feature. You do not need to create an account to use it. Open the app, tap on Scan on the top-right corner, and tap on Scan and Secure.
