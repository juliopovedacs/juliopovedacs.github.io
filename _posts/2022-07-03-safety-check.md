Apple announced a new feature for iPhones called [Safety Check](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s2qy3DCFI). This feature will be useful for survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) as it can allow them to stop sharing their location with anyone, including an abusive partner. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG4SGo0uVME) shows how to find and use **Safety Check** on an iPhone. It is important to keep in mind that **Safety Check** will be available worlwide with the launch of iOS 16 around September 2022.

It is great to hear that companies like Apple are working together with organizations like [NNEDV](https://nnedv.org/), [NCVC](https://victimsofcrime.org/), and [WESNET](https://wesnet.org.au/) to incorporate safety features on their products that can benefit at-risk populations like IPV survivors.

Before using or encouraging someone to use **Safety Check** it is key to do **safety planning** as using this feature to stop sharing location with someone might cause an escalation of abuse.
