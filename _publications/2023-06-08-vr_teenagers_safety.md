Social VR platforms like VRChat provide users wih the opportunity to interact with one another in virtual places. In this project, we interviewed teenagers, parents, and bystanders to identify the safety threats teenagers are facing in social VR. We highlight similarities and discrepancies between these stakeholders' perspectives, and highlight design recommendations for social VR platforms to become a safer place for teenagers.
